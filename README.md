Betina is an original Discord bot written in Python 3.6+ entirely in Portuguese, using the discord.py library. It plays requested songs from YouTube and other services in a Discord server and also has funny functions that might help the server administrator. The project is simple according to the functionalities and how other bots use the permission system, but it still in progress.

3. Copy the [main.py](main.py) archive and the [Music.py](Music.py);

- $devemenos @user quantity => decrease a quantity on how much a user owes you;
- $conversor coin1 coin2 => displays how much is the coin1 in relation to coin2;
- $ppt (pedra, papel ou tesoura) => It's a rock-paper-scissors game;
